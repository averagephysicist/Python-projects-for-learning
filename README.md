# Python-projects-for-learning
This is meant to be a record of my coding learning process
This is way to keep track of my coding learning process. Currently I am doing the 100 days of code from Udemy. I will only post the projects that I consider more interesting eventhough they are all for beginners.
I appreciate any constructive advice  :)
